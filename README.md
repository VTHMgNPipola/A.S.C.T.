# Advanced Structure Creation Tool

For the lack of a better name, I have choose one that pretty much
describes what is my aim with this "game".

## Introduction

In this game, inspired by The Powder Toy (referred as TPT in this
document), you can create electronic circuits that do all kinds of
stuff, but without all the hassle that creating such devices in real
life have.

Unlike TPT, the A.S.C.T. "world" is composed of layers. Each layer may
have a size of 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048, and even more tiles.

If you allocate enough RAM for it, a maximum theoretical size of more
than 32768x32768 can be reached, though I never could test that (my
computer does not have enough RAM). That's more than *1 **billion**
tiles **per layer***!   

## Development

As you may see the game is pretty much unusable, but I'll be adding more
and more stuff, and at some point I want to add modding support through
a Java library.

This project have the risk of being abandoned in early development
stage, so if you're reading this after 2020 or so that's probably what
happened.
